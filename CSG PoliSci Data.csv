This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the ""unalienable Rights"" of ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked ""insufficient funds.""""- MLK

I support equal pay- a job is a job- and pay should be based on ability not gender or color or any other measure. I do not consider equality part of the draft issue. With mandatory draft there is likely to be a strong push for women to be required serving in combat roles. Professional sports teams seem to easily understand that men and women are not physically equal (in general) and wouldn't mess around with co-ed teams; yet we as a country will potentially risk soldiers lives by allowing gender politics to interfere with sound decisions about armed combat service.

Therefore I strongly disagree with equal obligation of citizenship such as signing up for the military draft.
